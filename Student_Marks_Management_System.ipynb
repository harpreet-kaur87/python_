    "Student Marks Management System : \n",
    "\n",
    "This Python project is a simple student marks management system using a dictionary. It allows the user to add new students, update existing student marks, delete students, and display all student records. The program can also calculate the average marks and identify the student with the highest marks. This project demonstrates practical use of dictionaries, functions, and basic data management in Python."
